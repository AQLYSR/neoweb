                        <p>
                            Dear Readers,
                            <br>
                                I'm a moid searching for his foid
                                to do what loving moid and foid would do together.
                                I've been single for a while and ideally that would
                                not be the case any longer.
                                Hence, I'm putting myself out here to meet new people
                                and hopefully getting to know some of them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the longest time, I have a broken framework of love. I view love in a purely transactional way, that
                            I happened to have the a quality that you value and me yours, that I have to prove that I am someone worthy of love.
                            <a href={`${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}book/the-fault-in-our-stars`}>I could never understand why Gus want to be with dying Hazel.</a>
                            The nature of love to me is value-centric, and like all valuable things, is subjective.
                            But I was wrong. Love, to me, now, is about our shared experience and sharing the potential experience. It's no longer
                            an optimization problem. It's about sailing the ships together through the tide.
                            It's about my consciousness and yours converging into singularity. I still don't see
                            that love has an intrinsic value since it is still prone to external factors but I no longer believe that I have to break
                            my bones to have someone to be my side at the time of angst.
                        </p>

                            <li>
                                I'm currently doing my bachelor degree in physics,
                                majoring in electronics and semiconductor.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I able to speak and have a good amount of understanding in
                                Malay (thanks to being born in a Malay family),
                                English (thanks to my weird obsession with English literature
                                in my teenage years), and Japanese (thanks to my Japanese friends).

                                I'm obsessed with tennis. To me, it is the perfect sport.
                                If there can be only one sport and the rest vanish, it will be tennis.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I do photography amateurly. I treat it more as an artistic expression rather
                                than capturing photos for the sake of it.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I used to be a wordcel in my teenage years and my brain mainly
                                function as a shape rotators these days. Currenly working on reviving
                                the wordcel in me that I missed.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I'm an agnostic deist. I believe in the <a href="https://x.com/beffjezos/status/1680749234616954880">thermodynamic god</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_accelerationism">e/acc</a>.
                                My life's purpose is to accelerate entropy. But, for practical purposes,
                                I just say I'm non-religious.

                        <p>
                            I'm not the best person to describe myself since there, of course, will be bias.
                            If anything, what I'm going to say is just someone who I wish to be.
                            I will also put my friends' description of me sometimes later.
                            <br><br>
                            Bearing that in mind, I belive I am kind. I am open-minded with people's opinion.
                            I am ambitious. I easily dissatisfied with myself. I'm not an introvert but is not quite
                            outgoing either. I value status. I'm disciplined. I'm calm in moments of stress.
                            I am not easily get angry. I will not sit right when I'm bored. I seek for higher purpose.
                            I'm an optimist. I try to optimize every part of my life. I observe rather than project.
                            I always ponder.
                        </p>
                        <h3><strong>What Am I Looking For</strong></h3>
                        <p>
                            Each person is different and it is unfair to fit someone in one's set of idea. Like all ideal things,
                            this list is just wishful. With that in mind, treat this list as a good things to have in a partner
                            rather than boxes for you to tick.

                                someone who could remind me that it's okay to take some rest, that a failure is not the end
                                of it.

                                I would want to be with someone who is intelligent, someone who I could have a good conversation with,
                                a good banter. By intelligent, I mean it doesn't have to be in academical sense but rather someone
                                who able to challenge my beliefs and ideas.

                                but rather something more meaningful to you.

                            <li>
                                I know that youth isn't eternal, that we will eventually aged, but, ideally, I would want to be with someone
                                who take care of themselves, and have a good sense of aesthetic and keep me in check in that regards.
                            </li>
