# Grief, Death and Theory of Value (Love)

The Fault In Our Stars is a story of death, grief and what does it mean to love despite knowing that it won't have a happy ending. I don't understand why Gus choose to love a dying girl and knowing, for a fact, that he is dying himself. In my eyes, they are just dying couple who love each other and just trying to make the best out of the short life that they have. Why? Because they are human and love is what human do. There's no need reason to love and be loved.

This question emerged at the first place due to my beliefs in the theory of value that value emerged out of consciousness within human and living things. Every value that you put on something is purely subjective and can only exist because human exist. Without human, a gold is just a shiny rock. 

To me love has value because of the benefits that come with it in terms survivability and gene spreading. And since human matchmaking tend to optimize for such aspects, I see the best way to treat love is by working on signaling such traits to potential partners. From this perspective the value of love is inherently extrinsic. 

Let's say if I become a successful person and because of my success a girl end up with me. But then one day I end up in an accident and determined disabled for the rest of my life. Would then I'm unworthy of love? If the girl leave me, was there even love at the first place? For some people, they choose to stay in that relationship because of, you guess it, love.

> "I'm in love with you and I'm not in the business of denying myself in the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into a void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I'm in love with you" -- Augustus Waters

Perhaps I look at love the wrong way this whole time. To love is rarely about what we get but about what we give. It was the shared experienced that what make us love. Despite knowing for a fact that all our efforts will turn futile one day, we still insist on loving. 

From this perspective, love is still extrinsic. It's just I treat it more lightheartedly than before.

Like many other John Green's books, The Fault in Our Stars is a good story. A typical young adult romance book rarely touch upon the subject of death and the inherent meaninglessness of life. 

I give the Fault in Our Stars 3 and a half stars
